# Transformer-based Deep Learning Models (NLP/CV)
- Transformers are a class of deep learning models designed for handling sequential data, especially language.

### Examples: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, LayoutLM, Donut

They excel at understanding, generating, and reasoning about language (and, with extensions, also images/documents).

Fine-tuning: These models are pre-trained on massive text/image data, then fine-tuned for specific tasks (like question-answering, summarization, document understanding).
