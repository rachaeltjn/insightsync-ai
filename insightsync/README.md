# InsightSync-AI

**AI-powered Resume and Document Question Answering Demo**

This project demonstrates how to use modern NLP models (via HuggingFace Transformers) to extract and answer questions from PDF resumes and other documents.

## Features (as of July 2025)
- üìù Extracts text from PDF resumes (using pdfplumber)
- ü§ñ Answers natural-language questions about the document (e.g. "What diploma did Rachael Tan achieve?")
- üîç Optionally narrows to the Education section for more precise answers
- üì¶ Designed for easy extension to other document types and multimodal support

## Usage
- Place your PDF in the `data/` folder (or update the file path in `main.py`)
- Run the script with your question
- See the extracted answer!

## Roadmap / Future Vision
- Add support for images (OCR), audio, emails, spreadsheets
- Web dashboard and API endpoints
- Integration with business tools (Notion, Google Sheets, CRM, etc.)

## Why InsightSync?
Manual document review is slow and error-prone. This project shows how modern AI can help automate information extraction from business documents, starting with resumes.
